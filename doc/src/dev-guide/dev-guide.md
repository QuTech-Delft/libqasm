## File organization

For development, see:

- `include`: public headers.
- `src`: source files.
- `test`: test files.
- `python`: SWIG interface.
- `res`: resource files, for testing.

For build process, continuous integration, and documentation:

- `conan`: Conan profiles.
- `emscripten`: bindings and test for the Emscripten binaries.
- `scripts`: helper scripts used during the build process.
- `.github`: GitHub Actions configuration files.
- `doc`: documentation.

Build outputs may go into:

- `build/<build type>`: the C++ library output files generated by Conan.
- `pybuild`: the Python library output files generated by `setup.py`.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler with C++20 support (gcc 11, clang 14, msvc 17)
- `CMake` >= 3.12
- `git`
- `Python` 3.x plus `pip`, with the following package:
    - `conan` >= 2.0
- `SWIG`

### ARM builds

We are having problems when using the `zulu-openjdk` Conan package on an ARMv8 architecture.
`zulu-openjdk` provides the Java JRE required by the ANTLR generator.
For the time being, we install Java manually for this platform.

- `Java JRE` >= 11

### Documentation

- `doxygen`
- `mkdocs` with the following packages:
    - `mike` 
    - `mkdocs-material`
    - `mkdocstrings`
    - `pymdown-extensions`

## Build

This version of libQASM can only be compiled via the Conan package manager.
You will need to create a default profile before using it for the first time.

The installation of dependencies, as well as the compilation, can be done in one go.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/QuTech-Delft/libqasm.git
cd libqasm
conan profile detect
conan build . -pr:a=conan/profiles/tests-debug -b missing
```

!!! note

    - the `conan profile` command only has to be run only once, and not before every build.
    - the `conan build` command is building libQASM in Debug mode with tests using the `tests-debug` profile.
    - the `-b missing` parameter asks `conan` to build packages from sources
      in case it cannot find the binary packages for the current configuration (platform, OS, compiler, build type...).

### Profiles

A group of predefined profiles is provided under the `conan/profiles` folder.  
They follow the `[tests-|docs-](build_type)(-compiler)(-os)(-arch)[-shared]` naming convention:

- `tests`: if tests are being built.
- `docs`: if docs are being built.
- `build_type`: can be `debug` or `release`.
- `compiler`: `apple-clang`, `clang`, `gcc`, `msvc`.
- `os`: `emscripten`, `linux`, `macos`, `windows`.
- `arch`: `arm64`, `wasm`, `x64`.
- `shared`: if the library is being built in shared mode.

All the profiles set the C++ standard to 20.  
All the `tests`, except for `linux-x64` profiles, enable Address Sanitizer.

### Options

Profiles are a shorthand for command line options. The command above could be written, similarly,  as:

```shell
conan build . -s:a compiler.cppstd=20 -s:a libqasm/*:build_type=Debug -o libqasm/*:asan_enabled=True -c tools.build:skip_test=False -b missing
```

This is the list of options that could be specified either in a profile or in the command line:

- `libqasm/*:asan_enabled={True,False}`: enables Address Sanitizer.
- `libqasm/*:build_docs={True,False}`: builds documentation or not.
- `libqasm/*:build_type={Debug,Release}`: builds in debug or release mode.
- `libqasm/*:shared={True,False}`: builds a shared object library instead of a static library, if applicable.

Tests are disabled by default. To enable them, use `-c tools.build:skip_test=False`.

### Documentation

Build and serve on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by running the local `mkdocs` from the `doc` folder.

```shell
cd doc
python3 mkdocs serve
```

## Docker

This tests the library in a container with the bare minimum requirements for libQASM.

```shell
docker build .
```

**Note for Windows users:** The above might fail on Windows due to the `autocrlf` transformation that git does.
If you run into this issue, then create new clone of this repository:

```shell
git clone --config core.autocrlf=input git@github.com:QuTech-Delft/libqasm.git
```
